### Description:
Rss Reader is a service for aggregating RSS feeds, which makes it convenient to read a variety of sources, for example, blogs. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them itself and adds new entries to the general feed.

RSS is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements and other materials. This is the easiest way for sites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe to changes. For this, special services called RSS aggregators are used. These services can poll sitesâ€™ RSS feeds for new posts and display them in a convenient form, marking what has been read, and so on.
